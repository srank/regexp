* Character classes
* Refactor interfaces -- tidy up, make exports explicit, use smaller modules
* Tidy up types in Regexp - use a synonym for [(String, String)]
* Tidy up Tests - it's a bit of a mess; maybe split up?
* Error handling (everywhere!). I think we need a monad or two...
* Move the type Regexp to its own module
* Handle stdin rather than (or as well as) cmd line text
* Split parsing and tokenising into separate modules
